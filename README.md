# periodictable_c

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LEGOAnimal22/periodictable_c.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LEGOAnimal22/periodictable_c)

Translation of one of my old VB projects

I'm trying to learn C, so I thought I'd do a project. I wrote the original project in Visual Basic.

## How to Build

To build this project, use `make all` in the project's directory.

## How to Use

There are three ways to use this project:

+ 1. `-a [atomic number]`: Uses the atomic number to display information about the element.
+ 2. `-n [name]`: Uses the element's name to display information about that element. NOTE: The name must be in all lower-case letters. Ex. "chromium"
+ 3. `-s [symbol]`: Uses the element's symbol to display information about that element. NOTE: The first letter  of the symbol must be capitalized, and the rest lower-case. Ex. "Cr"
